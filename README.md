# Assistance-Scaner
An approach into taking assistance  into a classroom.

This proyect was created in the scope of my studies as a Mechatronics Engineer in the Universidad Politecnica de Chiapas, for a class called Adquisicion y Procesamiento de senales.

It uses several repositories from GitHub which I thank for sharing. Without this proyects this proyect could'nt have been possible.
